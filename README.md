# WebSocket Server
This websocket server was made just for practice and better understanding of how WebSockets operate. Ther eare zero documentation and tests, so it cannot be used in any kind of development in current state, but feel free to fork, explore and break it.

Example is available, after building project open `example` folder and run.
```
npm install
npm start
```
then open [index.html](http://localhost:8081/index.html) and send data.  
As a result with WebSocket server communication all messages will be displayed below mirrored.
